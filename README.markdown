Pest
====

**Pest** is a PHP client library for [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) 
web services.

Unlike [Zend_Rest_Client](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.rest.client.html), which is not 
really a "REST" client at all (more like RPC-over-HTTP), Pest supports the four REST verbs 
(GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and pays attention to HTTP response status codes.

***Note that this is the namespaced version of Pest, the namespace is 'Pest'***


Getting started with Composer
-----------------------------
Add the following to your project's composer.json

    "require": {
        "tuimz/pest": "dev-master",
    }
    
In the examples below use the namespaced version of Pest:

    <?php
    require '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $pest = new Pest\Pest('http://example.com');

Besides this all the examples below apply.

Basic Example
-------------

Pest's get/post/put/delete() return the raw response body as a string.
See the info on PestXML (below) if you're working with XML-based REST services and
PestJSON if you're working with JSON.

    <?php
    require 'Pest.php';

    $pest = new Pest('http://example.com');

    $thing = $pest->get('/things');

    $thing = $pest->post('/things', 
    	array(
    		'name' => "Foo",
    		'colour' => "Red"
    	)
    );

    $thing = $pest->put('/things/15',
    	array(
    		'colour' => "Blue"
    	)
    );

    $pest->delete('/things/15');

    ?>

Responses with error status codes (4xx and 5xx) raise exceptions.

    <?php

    try {
    	$thing = $pest->get('/things/18');
    } catch (Pest_NotFound $e) {
    	// 404
    	echo "Thing with ID 18 doesn't exist!";
    }

    try {
    	$thing = $pest->post('/things',  array('colour' => "Red"));
    } catch (Pest_InvalidRecord $e) {
    	// 422
    	echo "Data for Thing is invalid because: ".$e->getMessage();
    }

    ?>

PestXML
-------

**PestXML** is an XML-centric version of Pest, specifically targeted at REST services that 
return XML data. Rather than returning the raw response body as a string, PestXML will
try to parse the service's response into a [SimpleXML](http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php) object.

	<?php
	require 'PestXML.php';

	$pest = new Pest('http://example.com');

	$things = $pest->get('/things.xml');

	$colours = $things->xpath('//colour');
	foreach($colours as $colour) {
		echo $colour."\n";
	}

	?>

Similarly, **PestJSON** is a JSON-centric version of Pest.
